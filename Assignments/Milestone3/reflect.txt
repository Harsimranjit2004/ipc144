1Ans:
    1. void sort() this functino is used to sort the appointment data on the basis
    of the dates in this function i use the technique of the bubble sort to do that 
    i first started sorting the data from year then month and then goes to the end minutes
    if the preceeding value is less than the next value we can swap that values and store in
    the same array of the appointments, the appointment array is passed by value which mean we 
    need to sort the array for each function this function recieve the data pointer from the 
    other function which containg all the information about the patient and it is stored directly 
    to the pointer

    2. monthUpperLimit() this is the utility function that i used in the different main function
    in this function i find the days in the month and that specific year
    in this function i mainly used the if stament that check the month number and then return the
    days in the month. for this i define 2 arguments input first is the year and second one is the 
    month and its return type will be int as we are returning the days in the respective month

    3. inputCStringNumber() this function is specifically used taking input only for the phone number
    this function is upgraged version of the inputCString() this function provide phone number specific
    error and also ensure that the 10 digits is entered by the user
    in this i define 3 arguments first argument is the poniter to the string at which the data has to be 
    store , second it the minLength of the chacter and third one is the maxLength of the character
    its return type will be void as we are stroing the value through the pointer to function

2Ans:
    for the input  we are using the different moudle or file that is core.c which contain all the logic for 
    input and output if we are using the scanf in different function again and again it makes the code lengthy 
    moreover in the core.c we are also doing the validation of the input and we ensure that the correct input 
    is returned to the function if we include scanf in every function we need to do the validation of the input again and again 
    which decrese the readibility of the program we are only using only scanf for takinng the input which is good practice
    which makes the program highy cohesive with low coupling which is the good practice
    for the programming

3Ans: 
    void sort() and monthUpperLimit() is placed in the utility section of the clinic.c as these are the helper 
    function that is used in the other clinic.c function we need to seperate this function from the mainfunction 
    as the main function call this function whenever the function need the use of this function 

    inputCStringNumber() this function will be define in the core.c moudle as this function is taking the input 
    from the user and all the input function are in the core.c moudle which makes the input moudle different from the 
    clinic.c as all the main logic is defined in the clinic.c this concept is know as the modularity in which we makes the code 
    highly cohesive with low coupling
