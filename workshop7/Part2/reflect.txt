1Ans: For handling the repetitive coding part i use function for a specific 
    logic so that i can call only the function to the repetative coding logic
    like the display the board, or player position , in my code i send necessary
    arguments that helps the function to display the board accordingly
    like in display board i send struct gameInfo and playerInfo so that
    we can display the logic accordingly. so due to this i use functions
    in my coding logic. 

2Ans: Use of sturctures makes the workflow of coding easy as we can declare only
    use one variable for multiple types of values in context of code we use gameInfo
    struct that has four objects max_moves,path_length, bombs[], treasure[]
    so if we are not using struct, we need to create all this variables and arrays for
    individual that are not directly corelated to each other. my doing this we declare 
    lot of variables which may difficult to deal with. 

3Ans: 
    while(){
        for(){
            if{
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    in my code i  use two level of nested looping first is while loop and second level  is for loop
