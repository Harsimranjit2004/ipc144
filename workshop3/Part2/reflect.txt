1Ans : 
    (c_servings >= 1 && c_servings <= 4) for 250g 
    this logic comfirms that the customer servings are 
    A) => Relational expression used in the logic is two that is >= and <=
    b) => Logical expression used in the logic is only that is &&

2Ans:
    
    Without using DeMorgan's Law => (pid3 != pid1 && pid3 != pid2)

    Using DeMorgan's Law => !(pid3 == pid1 || pid3 == pid2) for this 
        if (pid3 == pid1 or pid3 == pid2 ) = ture that means that either pid3 = pid1 or pid3 = pid2 or equal to both which means it is not unique
        after the using ! operator we can get the desired result

    I used it without DeMorgan's law that is (pid3 != pid1 && pid3 != pid2)

3Ans:
    A) For 1st and simple method we can create the all the variable at the top as we need the variables in the program below

    B) we can optimize the above method also .  we can group the variable above at the top of main function in two group in which 1st group variables are for product table and 2nd group 
    is for storing the variables for the customer coffee preference by using this type we can identify the variables that which variables are for 
    product and which are for customer
