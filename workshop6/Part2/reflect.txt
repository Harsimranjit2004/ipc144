1Ans: 
    1.  For loop: This loop is used in that time when we know the range of
     itereration like in case of arrays we know the length of arrays so we 
     can iterate in that from 0 to last index.

    2.  while loop: in while loop the number of iterations that we are doing. 
    are not known beforetime or it depend on the user input and it continous.
     if as specific condition met.

    3. Do-while: it is same as while loop as it runs until the specific condition met.
     but it runs one time always it checks conditoin after doing work.
    In the case of arrays, we usually use the for loop as we already know the length of the arrays.


2Ans:
    For Syntax Testing : the console provide the description of the syntax error and also provide the 
    line number in which the syntax error occur. by using these infromation we can find the syntax error in our code

    For Semantic Error: Means for logical errors or issues that occur when the program runs, but the output is incorrect 
    to find these error 1st find the area in code where error occure then with use of print statement print the value of 
    incoreect variable before logic and after logic these will tell us about our logic that our logic is correct or not
    sometimes our logic is only true for specific set of entries 

3Ans:
    1st i go to this line and check the variable name is correct or not 
    2nd i print the value of variable before print statement to check the value of the variable if 
        it has correct value then this means in print statement the variable name is not correct or 
        if it is not correct then these means that above logic is incorrect

    or 
    if these statement using scanf for these values then these means that user are provide value 567.89 but according to testcases the value must be 0 so these couse this error.
