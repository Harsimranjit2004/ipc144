1Ans:
    1 The main advantage of using variables instead of using hardcode value it that we can change the value of the variable at runtime according to the userInput 
    2 secondally it makes the code maintainable as if any bug we found and we need to increament or decrement the value of the variable then we can change the variable value only if we use the hardcode we need to correct the values where this variable is used.
    3 thirdly it imporve the readiblity of the code as we usually declare the name of the variable according to the use cases of the variable 

2Ans:
    As while validating the rating values entered by the user we don't implement the arithematic logic for the total rating because 
        1 if we sum all the values that the user entered we can get the sum of all the values that user entered whether it is correct or not 
        2. moreover it divide the logic into 2 parts so which makes the good readiblity of the program 
        so it is easy to find bugs or test the code.
